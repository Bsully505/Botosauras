# Botosauras

```
Features to Add 
 - Currently all input needs to include all parameters.
       It should ideally be possible to provide input that is missing the advantage parameter and have the command still work
 - Skill is provided as a +2 but it should be provided as a skill(perception, history, etc.) and have the system look the modifier up.
